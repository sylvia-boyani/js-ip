So what we have here is a multi choice quiz website that has a quiz for a specific high school that has started
an after-school computer club. The club is finishing a course on Javascript and the students will have to take a 
test before completing.

1.2 Introduction

The objective of the project is to quiz the students in a simple and effecient way, whereby no student can cheat and
a quick way to analyze the skills obtained by the stiudents in javascript. In this way we reduce the stress that comes
